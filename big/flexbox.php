    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p> Flexbox is a very cool way to group and organize elements on your website. It is simple in concept (use a container that controls how elements in that container are organized in a logical, standardized fashion) but can be tricky to get right in practice. After pulling together a bunch of resources, to get the most out of Flexbox and become a flexbox pro, I recommend these three steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Familiarize yourself with Flexbox concepts.</strong> I highly recommend CSS-Tricks, CSS Referecne.io and Mozilla Developer for this. All are clear and easy guides that go through all the elements in an organized fashion. CSS-tricks is a little more simplified and has a lot of visual diagrams to illustrate the concepts, while Mozilla uses a clean, uncluttered but mostly text based approach. I really enjoyed CSS Reference in that they have the visuals for each attribute lined up for easy comparison.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Practicex3.</strong> Now that you know the concepts, practicing them in simple applications is the best way to cement that understanding and really see how they behave and interact with each other. CSS-Playground and CSS Help are good for initial visualization and playing around with different concepts. For more fun experimentation try playing Flexbox Froggy or Flexbox Defence. Froggy is a short game that gives you goals and lets you use basic flexbox attributes to achieve those goals (get the right frog on the matching lilypad).  Flexbox Defence takes a little bit longer, but if you enjoy tower defence, it’s a  good way to practice those flexbox skills in a structured but fun manner.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Apply to Real Scenarios.</strong> This can be the hardest step for some of us. Sure you have the concepts down and you finally know when you should use align vs justify, but how does that help you build your site? This is where I recommend going through Flexbox Patterns tutorial. This helps build that bridge between being able to apply flexbox concepts to colored blox and how those boxes translate to actual visual parts of your website. This helps further solidify your learning and spark new ideas as you see all the ways you can use flexbox (and in ways you probably hadn’t thought of before).</li>
    </ol>

<p>With these tools, I’m sure any interested web dev can go from flexbox newbie to flexbox pro. If you found any of these sources helpful or have sources you think should be added to the list for others, please hop over to my main page to give feedback and keep sharing the knowledge.</p>
